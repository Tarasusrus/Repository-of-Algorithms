# Repository-of-Algorithms
A collection of algorithms in Python, Java, and C++. Includes sorting, searching, graph traversal, dynamic programming, and more. Detailed descriptions, implementations, and examples. Improve your programming skills


Root directory: Contains the main README file and directories for each programming language used in the repository (e.g. "python", "java", "c++").

Language directories: Each language directory contains subdirectories for each algorithm category (e.g. "sorting", "searching", "graph-traversal", "dynamic-programming").

Algorithm category directories: Each algorithm category directory contains subdirectories for each individual algorithm (e.g. "merge-sort", "binary-search", "breadth-first-search", "knapsack-problem").

Algorithm directories: Each algorithm directory contains a README file with a description of the algorithm, an implementation file with the actual code, and one or more example files that demonstrate how to use the algorithm.
